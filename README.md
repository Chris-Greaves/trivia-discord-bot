# Trivia Discord Bot

This is a simple Trivia Discord Bot. It uses the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) to get the questions, and the [Discord.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Discord.Net/) NuGet package to integrate with Discord.  
This is to be used as an introduction to developing .Net core Discord Apps.
